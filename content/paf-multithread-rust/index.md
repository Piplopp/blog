# Parse a PAF with rust

Actualy I lost some time in a nice little side project ![yacrd](https://github.com/natir/yacrd) (for Yet Another Chimeric Read Detector), her I didn't explain what is a chimeric read, how we detect them, and why we need detect them. The only thing you need understand for this blog post is, yacrd need as input a read to read mapping information. The 2 more used format are paf or mhap they are quit similar and in fact it's just tsv
